## Favorite Existing Apps - Categorize and Evaluate
### Instagram
1. **Instagram**
 - Category
     - Social / Photo & Video
 - Mobile
     - Mainly mobile-centered, not much functionality on web, with app you can take pictures with camera and use more features
 - Story
     - Connect with other through pictures and video content
 - Market
     - Anyone with a phone/computer can use this app 
     - For personal and company use
 - Habit
     - User can frequently open the app to new content, users provide as well as consume almost endless amounts of content
 - Scope
     - Has core feature of posting images and interacting with other users posts, but has expanded to add random almost unrelated features (like shoppping)
2. **Messenger**
- Category
     - Social Networking
- Mobile
     - On desktop you access through facebook.com, while on mobile it is a stand alone app, otherwise not much difference
     - Mobile has real time notifications, sending photos is nicer on mobile due to camera integration
- Story
     - Message people (anybody you know on facebook) with text, images, and emoji reactions
     - Groups chats are easy (compared to other messenging services)
     - Integrated free internet video chats and calls 
- Market
     - Anyone, all you need is a facebook account
- Habit
     - Depends on how active the user chooses to be on the platform, one user may only open it once in a while if they get only a couple messages while another may open it a lot over the course of a day if they recieve/send many messages
- Scope
     - Main feature of messenging, a couple of extra add on features like polls that are nice to haves but are not necessary and were added later
3. **Venmo**
- Category
     - Finance
- Mobile
     - Can't send transactions on web, can only view transaction history
     - Can only send and recieve money on mobile, can scan QR code using mobile camera to quickly get someone else's account
- Story
     -  Easily accessible money transactions between friends and family and some small businesses
     -  Digital form cash (no overhead fees)
- Market
     - Anyone old enough to have a bank account and the need to send money to others
     - Especially popular among college aged and people in mid 20s (this demographic is more likely to split costs rather than treat someone to a meal)
- Habit
     - Not really habit forming, but is the dominant money sending app so many think of venmo first when wanting to split a bill
- Scope
     - Started with just core feature of sending money, only extra feature is that you can treat transactions like social media if the user is public

## New App Ideas - Evaluate and Categorize
1. Pop Up Event Locator
   - **Description**: 
   - **Category:** Social Bonding through events
   - **Mobile:** Mobile is essential to have login and share the events, photos, discreptions, and locations about events and other fun things to do for the rest of users. Camera will be used to share images. And also users will be able to compose and test and post. It will have acess for maps to show locations. Mobiles are convienient for this because they are easy to carry around to the place of events. And this makes it easy for instant loggin and status updates in real time(as events take palce.) 
   - **Story:** The users will be everyone who is vaccinated to attend events in public(also non-vaccinated ones as long as they wear masks since everything is open by law now.) Since things were close in cities all over the US for the past year, people have a highest tendency to look for events and spend time with crowd as much as possible. So this people will have accounts and whenever they find an interesting event, they will share how they feel about it including the pictures and locations so that others can joing as well. Also it will have a link for tipping and donating towards the perfomers of the event and also a direct link to there website and other social media pages if people want to follow them. This will create organized and multitasking platform for users and also adds value for event organizers(which will motivate them to promote the app to there fans further.)
   
   - **Market:** Anyone above a legal age will be able to use it. And it can monitize by from targetted Ads. Also it will monitize by getting 5-10% of the tips that are being given to the performers as the platfor enables tipping and donating easy and habitual. 
   - **Habit:** Event organizers will be able to use it and promote it constantly. And anyone who want is lookign for events and crowd to spend time with will use it constantly(specially during this post-covid time.)
   - **Scope:** V1 would allow...  V2 would incorporate...  V3 would add a way...  V4 would incorporate...
